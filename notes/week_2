"Tail recursion" is a function that calls itself as its last action

they are iterative 

in general if the last action of a function is a calling to another function (which may be itself) one stack frame would be sufficient for both functions. this is called "tail-calls"

the examples from the videos:

def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (b==0) a else gcd(b, a % b)

gcd is tail recursive - rewriting sequence of constant size


def factorial(n: Int): Int = if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

is NOT tail recursive - the last call is not to itself, and as such all the elements need to be kept to deliver the final result

*** this is helpful in avoiding stack overflow exceptions. But remember, clarity trumps efficience. like donald knuth said, "premature optimization is the source of all evil"

in scala the "@tailrec" annotation can be used, and if not tail recursive an error will be thrown 

It pretty much behaves like a loop in an imperative program


"Higher-order Functions" - functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions as results, i.e. they act on other functions 

the opposite is "first order functions" they act on data values

in functional languages, functions are first class values


"anonymous functions" - function literals, i.e. declared on the "fly"

parameter   body
(x: Int) => x * x * x


"functions returning another function"

def sum (f: Int => Int): (Int,Int) => Int = {
	
	def sumF(a:Int, b:Int): Int = {
		//implementation
	}

	sumF
} 


def sumCubes = sum(x => x * x * x)

sumCubes(1, 10)


BUT this can be simplified by avoiding the middleman

def cube (x: Int):Int = x * x * x

sum cube (1,10) == (sum(cube)) (1,10)

syntatic sugar to re-write a function returning a function:

def sum (f: Int => Int)(a:Int, b:Int): Int = {
	//implementation
}
