the style of functional programming means: avoid mutations, get new ways to abstract and compose functions 


*** formal model of evaluation - substition model? - all evaluation does is reduce an expression to a value - lambda calculus

can only be applied to immutable actions


call-by-value: evaluates the functions first - evaluates every function argument only once

call-by-name: defers evaluation to the last moment - argument is not evaluated if its not used

Call-by-name vs Call-by-value

def test(x: Int, y: Int) = x * x

test (2,3)

CBV
2 * 3
6

CBN
2 * 3
6


test (3+4, 8)

CBV
test (7, 8)
7 * 8
56

CBN
3+4 * 8
7 * 8
56


test (7, 2*4)

CBV 
test (7, 8)
7 * 8
56

CBN
7 * ( 2 * 4 )
7 * 8
56 


test(3 + 4, 2 * 4)

CBV
test(7, 8)
7 * 8
56

CBN
(3 + 4) * (2 * 4)
7 * (2 * 4)
7 *  8
56


BUT not every expression reduces to a value (in a finite number of steps):

def loop: Int = loop              <--- will never reduce - it resolves to itself... 


if CBV terminates, CBN terminates, but the opposite is not true

def first(x: Int , y: Int) = x

first(1, loop)

under CBN, loop is not evaluated, 1 is returned

under CBV they are both evaluated, so it gets stuck on loop
