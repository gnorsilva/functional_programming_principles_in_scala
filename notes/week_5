Right Associativity:

Normally method calls are actioned from left to right

foo.doSomething()

But in scala operators ending in ':' are seen as method calls of the right-hand operand

val nums = 1 :: 2 :: Nil

is actually

val nums = Nil.::(2).::(1)


Tuples:

Tuples can have 'n' elements, for eg a pair is a tuple with 2 elements

tuples can be assigned with pattern matching. for a pair you can do:

val pair = ("something", 10)
val(label, value) = pair 
println(label) // > "something"
println(value) // > 10
