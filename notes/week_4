difference between having

1. class foo(val x: Int)

and 

2. class foo(_x: Int) = def x = ...

In the 1st case the "val x" is only evaluated when the object is instantiated, where as in the 2nd case (with a def) the values are evaluated everytime the method is referenced

in scala val definitions are really special cases of methods

 

type bounds:

[T <: P]     T subtype of P

[T >: C]     T supertype of C    

[T >: C <: P] S is super of C AND sub of P

Covariance: 

NonEmpty <: Intset

covariance means that 

List[NonEmpty] <: List[IntSet]


But, covariance can lead to problems, like in this java example:

NonEmpty[] a = new NonEmpty[2]{}
IntSet[] sets = a
sets[0] = Empty
NonEmpty non = a[0] 		// This shouldn't happen!


Liskov's substitution principle tells us when a type can be a suptype of another.

"If A <: B then everything one can do with a value of type B, one should also be able to do with a value of type A"

The actual definition is a bit more formal:

"Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type B
Then q(y) should be provable for objects of type A where A <: B"


for C[T], given types A and B such that A <: B:

covariant:	 	C[A] <: C[B]
contravariant: 	C[A] >: C[B]
nonvariant:		neither C[A] nor c[B] are subptypes of each other


class definitons of variance in scala:
covariant:	 	class C[+A] {...}
contravariant: 	class C[-A] {...}
nonvariant:		class C[A] {...}


Functions are 'contravariant' in their argument type(s) and 'covariant' in their result type. eg:

If A2 <: A1 and B1 <: B2, then

	A1 => B1 <: A2 => B2

Rougly in scala:
	- 'covariant' only in method results
	- 'contravariant' only in method parameters
	- 'nonvariant' anywhere else



val xs: List[NonEmpty] = ...
val x: Empty = ....
xs prepend x  		<-- what is the type returned? a List[IntSet]

Scala will, through type inference, try to return the supertype that satisfies both


***** These are discouraged in Scala

x.asIstanceOf[T]
x.asIstanceOf[T]

Decomposition

Obs: the sole purpose of test and accessor functions is to 'reverse' the construction process
	- which subclass was used?
	- what were the arguments of the constructor?
