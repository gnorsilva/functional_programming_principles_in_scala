difference between having

1. class foo(val x: Int)

and 

2. class foo(_x: Int) = def x = ...

In the 1st case the "val x" is only evaluated when the object is instantiated, where as in the 2nd case (with a def) the values are evaluated everytime the method is referenced

in scala val definitions are really special cases of methods
